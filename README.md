# F24-INDR220-HW2-Coin_Problem

This project solves the Coin Distribution Problem using Integer Linear Programming (ILP) and CPLEX.

A parent tries to distribute N coins to M children such that each child gets coins summing up to the same total value. The goal is to find an optimal assignment using binary decision variables.

## ðŸ“„ Input:
	â€¢	coins.txt: A single-row file with coin values.
	â€¢	Number of children (M).

## ðŸ§  Formulation:
	â€¢	Each coin must be assigned to exactly one child.
	â€¢	Each child must receive coins summing up to the same total value.
	â€¢	Solved via ILP with binary variables xij âˆˆ {0,1}.

## ðŸ›  Implementation:
	â€¢	Python function: coin_distribution_problem(coins_file, M)
	â€¢	Solver: IBM CPLEX
	â€¢	Environment: Azure Lab Services

ðŸ“Œ Note: Only partitions with equal total coin value are considered feasible.
